# Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

# An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

# Example 1:
# Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
# Output: true

# Example 2:
# Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
# Output: false

class Solution:
    def valid_anagram(self, s, t):
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False

        count_s, count_t = {}, {}
        for i in range(len(s)):
            count_s[s[i]] = 1 + count_s.get(s[i], 0)
            count_t[t[i]] = 1 + count_t.get(t[i], 0)

        for c in count_s:
            if count_s[c] != count_t.get(c, 0):
                return False

        return True
